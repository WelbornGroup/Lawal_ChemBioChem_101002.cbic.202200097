This repository contains the PDB files and electric field data from DOI:10.1002/cbic.202200097. 
The MD trajectories are available on Zenodo, saved under the paper title (Structural Dynamics Support Electrostatic Interactions in the Active Site of Adenylate Kinase)

All the simulations were done from the source PDB file PDB:1AKE such that the files are named

1AKE_i_j.pdb where i is either WT, A37G, A55G, V135G or V142G and j is a number from 1 to 25 that refers to the conformation number, as described in the paper. The MD trajectories on Zenodo are labelled similarly. 

The electric field data is labeled

401407_i_j.csv where i and j have the meaning described above. In these files:
- the first column is the residue number (including solvent and ligand), 
- the second column is the average electric field and 
- the third column is the standard deviation of the electric field
